							<strong>Hogwarts Dormitory</strong> is a dormitory used by
							students at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a
							place to live while studying at Hogwarts, the division of this
							dormitory is based on a selection made by the selection hat. In
							the Harry Potter series, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
							Wizardry is divided into four houses, each bearing the surname of
							its founders Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena
							Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. The houses compete with each other
							during their time in school, adding or subtracting numbers from
							various events, to earn the Boarding Cup. Each has its own
							Quidditch team competing for the Quidditch Cup. The most frequent
							(and most exciting) competition and rivalry between Gryffindor
							House and Slytherin, which even in the story tends to lead to
							hostility. The hostel at Hogwarts is a place to live and study for
							every student.
						</p>

							<strong>Gryffindor</strong> is one of the fictional house names in
							J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Gryffindor House is at
							Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Gryffindor House's
							identity animal is a lion. Red and gold are Gryffindor's proud
							colors. The name was taken from one of the founders of the school,
							Godric Gryffindor. He was one of the greatest wizards of his time.
							Gryffindor lived about a thousand years ago with Rowena Ravenclaw,
							Helga Hufflepuff, and Salazar Slytherin. Gryffindor's present
							remains are the selection hat that once belonged to him and a
							sword studded with jewels and engraved with his name which is now
							kept in Professor Albus Dumbledore's office.
						</p>
						<br />
						<strong>Hufflepuff</strong>, founded by Helga Hufflepuff, values
						hard work, patience, loyalty, dedication, tolerance and fairness
						above all. The boarding identity animals are the badger and the
						canary with yellow and black as their proud colors. The Fat Friar is
						a dorm keeper ghost. According to Rowling, Hufflepuff corresponds to
						the earth element, where the dormitory where they live is located in
						the basement, near the Hogwarts kitchen.

							<strong>Ravenclaw</strong> highly values intelligence, creativity,
							resourcefulness, wisdom, and individuality. "Infinite intelligence
							is man's most precious treasure" is a quote frequently repeated by
							Ravenclaw. The boarding symbol is an eagle, and uses blue and
							bronze colors (although in the film blue and silver are used). The
							house ghost is the Gray Lady, who is revealed in Harry Potter and
							the Deathly Hallows as Helena Ravenclaw, the daughter of Hogwarts
							founder Rowena Ravenclaw. According to Rowling, Ravenclaw is
							related to the element of air. Rowena Ravenclaw is also the owner
							of the crown, which is later proven to be a horcrux in this
							seventh book. If you pay close attention throughout the story
							series, the majority of the students who live in this dormitory
							can be said to be beautiful and attractive, like Cho Chang,
							Harry's first girlfriend. Then, Luna Lovegood is also said to be
							beautiful in the sixth book, at Slughorn's Christmas party.
						</p>
						<br /><br />
						<p>
							<strong>Slytherin</strong> like it's founder, Salazar Slytherin,
							the Slytherin house judges on ambition, cunning (cunning),
							leadership talent, long wits, tendencies to break rules and (on
							average) pure blood ancestry. The book also states that the thirst
							for power is a characteristic of Slytherins. The animal that
							symbolizes Slytherin is a snake, and uses green and silver as
							identity colors. The Bloody Baron is the ghost of the Slytherin
							house. The dorm's common room is also located underground, but
							it's different from Hufflepuff's. Slytherin's basement is located
							beneath the lake giving the room a greenish tinge, this room is
							also equipped with green lights and carved chairs. According to
							Rowling, Slytherin is associated with the element of water.
							Slytherin traits are prone to being misused for crime.
